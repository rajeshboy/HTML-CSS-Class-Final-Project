				<p class = "organic"> I was born in a farming community in <i>Nadi</i> which is a city in <b>Fiji Islands.</b> My father was a wealthy farmer. We planted corn, sugarcane, rice, 
					coconut, bananas, papaya, oranges, mangoes, tomatoes, okra, eggplant, pepper, potatoes, sweet-potatoes, pumpkin, cassava, yams, beans,  
					peas, cabbage, bokchoy, lettuce, cauliflower, and some other greens, and herbs. Currently, I am running a vegetable farm at Hillsborough  
					in North Carolina. It's called <strong>Raj's Organic</strong>. We plant 3 seasonal crops, that are Spring, Summer, and Fall. Our farm is certified organic and we build our 
					own organic compost on the farm.

					Sugarcane Farming in Fiji </a>
				<p class = "fiji" > Sugarcane is a tropical perennial crop, and is planted in trenches for about 4 to 6 inches deep. The land is prepared with tractor driven 
					plough in flat areas and bullock or horse carted plough is used in hilly areas. The harvesting season is mostly in the drier months 
					when the sugar content in the cane is higher. Sugarcane is harvested by machines as well as manually with a cane-knife. Sugarcane is 
					transported to the sugar mills by trucks as well as locomotive pulled carts. The juice from the sugarcane is extracted and processed to make 
					sugar.

				<a class = "honolulu" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/HalfPasttheBay/gardening-in-hawaii/"> Farming in Hawaii </a>
				<p class = "hawaii"> Hawaii has a tropical climate which is suitable for a lot of vegatables and fruits. Bananas, oranges, papayas, mangoes, coconuts, and other 
				tropical fruits grow well in Hawaii. The climate there is very good for tropical perennials as they grow well after the harvest. Hawaii is also
				doing permanent agriculture with coconut, oranges, papayas, guavas, mangoes, and other fruits. Vegetables like Eggplant, Tomatoes, Pepper,
				Okra and others, last longer in that climate.

				<blockquote cite="https://themicrogardener.com/frugal-gardening-how-to-get-plants-for-free/">
					<p> Pruning, dividing and removing plants that have gone to seed are regular maintenance activities for many gardeners each season.   
						These are also prime times to add to your garden from what is often plant material that will go to waste in someone else’s garden. 
						Next time you see your neighbour doing some gardening, have a chat over the fence and ask if there’s anything they want to get rid of. 
						Offer to swap or share something from your garden or kitchen in return.  If you’re good in the kitchen, invite them over for a cuppa or 
						something home baked. Bribery works wonders!
